# VUCTF2025
I had the pleasure of joining the team "EMAIgine Dragons" in this years VUCTF. This directory contains write-ups of the challenges I completed during the CTF. 
The theme of the CTF competition were sentient Roomba's taking over the world, which was a fun touch.
* [Toaster](https://github.com/TSpeel/writeups/tree/main/VUCTF2025/Toaster) was a pwn challenge about bypassing ASLR.
* [Roomba-Rebellion](https://github.com/TSpeel/writeups/tree/main/VUCTF2025/Roomba-Rebellion) was a web challenge about path traversal.
* [Time](https://github.com/TSpeel/writeups/tree/main/VUCTF2025/Time) was a misc challenge about exploiting timing differences.
* [Baby-Roomba](https://github.com/TSpeel/writeups/tree/main/VUCTF2025/Baby-Roomba) was a Python code injection challenge.
* [Big-Roomba](https://github.com/TSpeel/writeups/tree/main/VUCTF2025/Big-Roomba) was the follow-up to the Baby-Roomba challenge.
